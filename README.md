Applied Machine Learning using TensorFlow

Many people in the world depend on agriculture for their income. Indeed, we all depend on the agricultural industry directly or indirectly. When plants are affected by diseases,
they have considerable negative influences on the quantity and quality of products. The risk of food insecurity increases if these diseases are not detected and diagnosed in time.
Climate change and pollution are reasons for the plants to come in contact with different diseases. Cultivators in any country face severe losses because of these diseases. For
leaf disease, the amount of crop production is decreasing day by day. Use of Deep learning is penetrating into every next industry one could imagine. One of them is agriculture.
The main idea is the detection of early plant diseases to improve the crop yield. However, so far, the most important method to diagnosing plant diseases has been direct and visual
monitoring by experienced people and plant specialists, and this method requires continuous monitoring by experts, and it is obvious that this has cost a lot of money for manufacturers.
In addition, meeting agricultural specialists is not possible at all times. Especially in developing countries, farmers have to travel long distances to access specialists in agriculture and
plant diseases, which in addition to spending time requires great investment. Due to the advancement of science and the introduction of new techniques, the previous methods are
useless and expensive. If we can detect disease at the primary stage it will help to the growth of the production. Ignorance of this cannot be affordable and to prevent it use of chemical
pesticides is very harmful. Use of pesticides damages the soil and environment. Early identification of diseases in crops is very effective and helpful for the process. With the help
of Artificial intelligence and computer vision, farmers can automatically detect the plant diseases through raw images of plant leaves. Techniques of image processing are generally
used in agriculture and it is applied for the detection and recognition of weeds, fruit-grading, identifying and calculating disease infestations of plants, and plant genomics. Currently,
the introduction of deep learning methods turns out to be popular. Deep learning a branch of artificial intelligence is an advanced method of ML that uses neural networks that works
like the human brain. General methods are like classification methods.
